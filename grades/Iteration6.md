#### Group Number: 4 Survival maps

#### Presentation

  - Clearly stated goals. And interesting, too.
  - Diagrams could've been a little bit better than just drawings.
  - The non-CRUD algorithm you made a good shot at explaining, but it was not completly clear to us in the end.

##### App demo comments.  Did any errors/glitches arise during the demo?

 - Your Heroku web app is a bit flakey, but cool that you even have it.
 - You are getting some good routes but also some more improvement is needed.
 - Glitch in demo with link to route (web to iOS)
 - Good demo of moving through the route.
 - The application does not take into consideration the time of the day.
 - The code review was of a database query. Not terribly revealing.


##### UI quality -- look and usability

- heat map changes granularity as you zoom in/out - make it more consistent and make it more like highlighter. (This may have only been in the web version)
- Search state on phone looks really nice.  Generally the phone UI looks very good.
- The list of possible search results looks very helpful -- that's a new
  feature.

#### Iteration 6

##### Code inspection

- Looks like the code has evolved quite a bit from iterations 4 and 5!
- Most problems from before seemed cleaned up.
- Still see some lat/long getting passed around when you have a Coordinate
      class that's supposed to contain it.

##### Architecture - was the code cleanly structured in terms of packages, deployment, etc

- All good.

##### Tests - good coverage?  Travis working?

- Travis works, code is tested.

##### Final code documentation

- Jazzy page was not working but I know you have it.

##### GitHub usage

- Feature branches being used, issues cleared.
- My one pet peeve: Write better messages. (It takes a bit of practice, but
  it's helpful!)

#### Project difficulty in terms of lines of code, conceptual difficulty, non-CRUD features, degree of completion

- Nice use of gaussian in heat map
- good use ot MapQuest service and avoidance points
- two front-ends, bonus points!
- Good pull of crimebaltimore records for external data.
- Very good amount of non-CRUD code for the route finding, also very clever.

#### Overall remarks

This project required a lot of nontrivial tool integration and data collection and analysis.  Your demo overall went very well.  Congratulations on a very nice project!
